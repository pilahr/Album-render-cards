# Objects Album Challenge ðŸª•

## Requirements

- Create and link a new JavaScript file to the existing index.html file
- Create a new object and add the properties we will need to produce this card (you can use any album you like)
- Using what you know about DOM manipulation, create a function that will render this card to the page
  - It should accept an `albumObject` as a parameter

## Extension

- Create an array of three album objects and using array iterators, render all three to the page at the same time
